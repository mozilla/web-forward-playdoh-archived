    <h2>General</h2>
    <ul class="questions cf">
        <li class="c4 question">
            <div class="Q">How does this work?</div>
            <div class="A serif">In a nutshell: <a href="{{ url('apply') }}">Apply</a> with your project (which fits into the <a href="{{ url('index') }}#interests">predefined interest areas</a> and will be built with the <a href="{{ url('index') }}#interests">traits that are important for the open Web</a>), get accepted, come to San Francisco for our 4 week camps, build/learn/mingle, launch your product, decide how to take it forward. More details can be found <a href="{{ url('index') }}">here</a>.</div>
        </li>
        <li class="c4 question">
            <div class="Q">Will this happen in cities other than San Francisco (and other countries than the US)?</div>
            <div class="A serif">Oh yes. We just felt it's best to do our first iteration(s) close to home.</div>
        </li>
        <li class="c4 question">
            <div class="Q">Why do you do this?</div>
            <div class="A serif">We mainly have three reasons to do this (and not to forget to mention-we just love working with people such as yourself):
                <ul>
                    <li>Spur innovation &amp; develop solutions in <a href="{{ url('index') }}#interests">the predefined problem spaces/areas</a>
                    <li>Support you to build these solutions with the <a href="{{ url('index') }}#interests">traits that are important for the open Web</a>
                    <li>Bolster Mozilla's effectiveness in the world through this program
                </ul>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li class="c4 question">
            <div class="Q">Who's behind this program?</div>
            <div class="A serif">Mozilla (we're probably best known as the maker of the <a href="http://firefox.com">Firefox</a> web browser). More specifically <a href="http://mozillalabs.com">Mozilla Labs</a> - the part of the Mozilla organization where we tinker with and explore the fringes of what's possible today on the Web.</div>
        </li>
        <li class="c4 question">
            <div class="Q">What will I eat and where will I sleep during the 4 week program?</div>
            <div class="A serif">We give an allowance of $2,000 per team member for the 4 weeks of the program (up to $6,000 total per team). This is enough money to find a nice apartment and eat plenty of food (not only ramen). We also have plenty of free coffee.</div>
        </li>
        <li class="c4 question">
            <div class="Q">How much control do I give up for joining your program?</div>
            <div class="A serif">Nothing. Nada. Nichts. Did we say "we are different"? We want you to build something which has the potential to change the world. And we're sure you remember us when you strike that pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Because that's what we would do for you. But other than that - nothing, really. We want you to bring your idea into the Mozilla community, we want to learn from you (at least as much as you learn from us), we want you to write Open Source code and we want you to build an awesome product. That's all.</div>
        </li>
        <li class="c4 question">
            <div class="Q">Can we turn our idea into a business?</div>
            <div class="A serif">Sure. And we're happy to help as much as we can. In particular Pascal is interested in developing new business models for Open Source companies and popularizing them - as he believes that there is a lot of innovation in this area.</div>
        </li>
        <li class="c4 question">
            <div class="Q">This sounds (insert your term of excitement here)! What's the catch?</div>
            <div class="A serif">None. Seriously. And if you still don't believe us - email us at 'webfwd at mozilla.com', ping us on <a href="http://irc.mozilla.org">IRC</a> or if you're in the area just swing by. We're also attending a bunch of events where you can meet with us.</div>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Application Process</h2>
    <ul class="questions cf">
        <li class="c4 question">
            <div class="Q">Do I need a prototype?</div>
            <div class="A serif">Yes. And no. You don't need a full fledged prototype. But you need more than just an idea. You need code, mockups, something tangible. Most of all - you actually need to be able to pull this off and be able to build your product/service.</div>
        </li>
        <li class="c4 question">
            <div class="Q">What are you looking for in a founding team?</div>
            <div class="A serif">Mainly the ability to deliver what you set out to do. This often means a great combination of core skills. If your team is missing key skills it's not a deal-breaker but it surely will be much harder.</div>
        </li>
        <li class="c4 question">
            <div class="Q">Do you only take teams?</div>
            <div class="A serif">Not necessarily. But it is certainly easier to build a product if you're not a lone soldier but come as a group of people with strong core skills.</div>
        </li>
        <li class="c4 question">
            <div class="Q">Can I only apply if I'm a US citizen/live in the US?</div>
            <div class="A serif">No. We love to have people from diverse cultural backgrounds in the program - having said that: For the first iteration(s) you must be able to legally work in the US for the duration of the program.</div>
        </li>
        <li class="c4 question">
            <div class="Q">Am I too young or too old for your program?</div>
            <div class="A serif">As long as you fulfill the legal requirement (i.e. you are at least 18 years old) we are golden.</div>
        </li>
        <li class="c4 question">
            <div class="Q">Can we do it without moving to where you are?</div>
            <div class="A serif">No. Sorry to be firm on this one - but the whole program is designed around the fact that you are here, working next to us. And believe us - it's much more fun to do this in person anyway.</div>
        </li>
        <li class="c4 question">
            <div class="Q">Do I need to work on this full-time?</div>
            <div class="A serif">We understand that you might not have worked on your project full-time until now. And that's okay. But when you come here, it's time for the rubber to hit the proverbial road - and for you to do this all-in and full-time. It'll be fun. And rewarding. And a great ride. So don't worry.</div>
        </li>
        <li class="c4 question">
            <div class="Q">Can I apply with a product/service even if it doesn't fit into one of those areas?</div>
            <div class="A serif">Yes. But be aware of the fact that we primarily look for solutions which fit into the areas we identified as <a href="{{ url('index') }}#interests">our interest foci</a>.</div>
        </li>
        <li class="c4 question">
            <div class="Q">What is the selection process?</div>
            <div class="A serif">We have a selection committee who will select the participating teams based on fit to our interest areas, overall compliance with the traits we care about and (obviously) potential of idea and team. We might invite a few of you to join us for follow-up calls/video conferences or in-person meetings if we have questions.</div>
        </li>
        <li class="c4 question">
            <div class="Q">Why didn't you choose me?</div>
            <div class="A serif">Don't fret. Us not choosing you is by no means a statement about your skills or your idea. You just might not be a good fit for the program at this moment in time.</div>
        </li>
        <li class="c4 question">
            <div class="Q">What's the deadline for my application?</div>
            <div class="A serif">There is no deadline. We have a rolling submission process and accept projects at pretty much any time.</div>
        </li>
        <li class="c4 question">
            <div class="Q">Do I need a business plan (and what is this anyway)?</div>
            <div class="A serif">No, we don't require a business plan. And if you don't know what this is - no worries. We'll figure out together.</div>
        </li>
        <li class="c4 question">
            <div class="Q">We are already incorporated (a company) - can we still apply?</div>
            <div class="A serif">Yes, that's not a deal-breaker. As long as you're willing to comply with our <a href="{{ url('index') }}#interests">requirements</a>.</div>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Camp</h2>
    <ul class="questions cf">
        <li class="c4 question">
            <div class="Q">What happens during the 4 week camp?</div>
            <div class="A serif">First and foremost - you will build your product. In the process of doing so you will meet with other Mozillians, exchange ideas, get critiqued, learn and present. About two or three nights a week we'll organize sessions with our mentors. We'll organize a couple of cool events around the program which give you even more chance to mingle and network. We will make sure you'll have a great time.</div>
        </li>
        <li class="c4 question">
            <div class="Q">What happens after the 4 week camp?</div>
            <div class="A serif">At the end of the 4 week camp you will present your product to the wider Mozilla community. You will make a decision on how to take this forward (with which we will help you). After that it's a highly individual process - as there are so many variables in this game. Rest assured - we're here to help.</div>
        </li>
        <li class="c4 question">
            <div class="Q">Who are your mentors &amp; experts?</div>
            <div class="A serif"><a href="{{ url('mentorship') }}">Here</a> is a complete list. Generally speaking they are all amazing experts in their respective fields. And a lot of fun to hang out with.</div>
        </li>
        <li class="c4 question">
            <div class="Q">What is a typical mentoring session?</div>
            <div class="A serif">Typically a mentor spends some time with all teams in a (usually highly interactive) presentation, then goes on to sit down with individual teams to answer questions, provide insights, give direction, etc. Often mentors hang around for a drink or two in the evening.</div>
        </li>
        <li class="c4 question">
            <div class="Q">What else do you provide? Office space, infrastructure, ramen?</div>
            <div class="A serif">A whole bunch of cool stuff - you get a desk in our of our beautiful, brimming with great energy MozSpaces; we help you with servers, software, UI, UX, design... the list goes on and on. Basically all the stuff you need to get your project off the ground (and don't get us wrong - it's not that we're doing all this for you - sorry lazy bums... But we are here to help!).</div>
        </li>
        <li class="c4 question">
            <div class="Q">What about networking (not the cable-type but the meat-space type)</div>
            <div class="A serif">Plenty of it. The power of networking can't be underestimated. More often then not it's the people you know who will make or break a particular idea. So we make sure you meet lots of the right people. And if networking is something which doesn't come naturally for you - we'll help.</div>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Other</h2>
    <ul class="questions cf">
        <li class="c4 question">
            <div class="Q">What do you exactly mean when you say my technology must be Open Source?</div>
            <div class="A serif">Simple: All the code you write during the program (and as a prerequisite the code you base your work on during the program) needs to be released under a <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/">tri-license (MPL, GPL and LGPL)</a> or similarly open license. This is exactly the same way we release our software including Firefox.</div>
        </li>
        <li class="c4 question">
            <div class="Q">What if my project turns out to be a dud?</div>
            <div class="A serif">No worries. Such is life (sometimes). The world will not end.</div>
        </li>
        <li class="c4 question">
            <div class="Q">Are you looking for mentors and other people &amp; organizations which can help?</div>
            <div class="A serif">Yes. Please send us an email at 'webfwd at mozilla.com'.</div>
        </li>
        <li class="c4 question">
            <div class="Q">Are you hiring?</div>
            <div class="A serif">In fact we are. Check out <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/about/careers.html">Mozilla's open job listings here</a>.</div>
